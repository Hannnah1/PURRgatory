# PURRgatory
Purrgatory is an rpg following the story of a cat stuck in cat purgatory.  To fully move on to the cat afterlife he must travel back through his 9 lives, rescuing each soul along the way. Luckily Pj (The cat) is not alone in purrgatory and finds plenty of other dead cat friends to help him along the way. ![Image](https://github.com/Hannnah1/PURRgatory/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-19%20at%2012.52.07%20AM.png)

# Development
This began as my undergraduate thesis project. Currently this repository only exists as an easy means for friends and classmates to download and play the game.
Due to an extreme lack of time and smarts, this game is pretty damn far from being finished. The "demo-like" version will be available in a few weeks probably. There will be a build for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

#Gameplay
* WASD keys to move
* Space to jump
* F to chat
  * Scroll wheel to choose responses
  * enter to confirm responses  
* I to access inventory
* Q to fly or boat (where applicable)
## Known Bugs and Limitations
There's a lot...Don't try to break it, because I can guarantee you will.
